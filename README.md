This will start the Laravel development server. You can access the application at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
And if you want to check the all guest list that has been registered, please access:
```
http://localhost:8000/guests/all
```

### Step 4: Start Docker Services
Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code, navigate to the docker-serve/ directory, and start the Docker containers:
```
cd docker-serve/
docker compose up
```
And if you want to visit the database adminer, access the link below:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
Set the requirement like below:
```
server: mysql
username: root
passwword: root
database: 
```

### Step 5: Run Migrations

```
php artisan migrate
```

### Notes
If you encounter any errors during setup, try the following:
1.	**Restart Docker Desktop:** Ensure all containers are running without errors.
2.	**Clear Laravel Cache:** Run the following commands:
```
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```
3. **Check Docker Logs:** inspect logs for any issues with the containers:
```
docker compose logs
```
4.	**Re-run Migrations:** If the database is not set up correctly, try:
```
php artisan migrate:fresh
```
